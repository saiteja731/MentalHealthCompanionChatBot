# **Language and Libraries:**
# - **Python**: We are using Python because it's simple and very powerful for tasks like making a chatbot. It has many libraries that help us handle text, numbers, machine learning, and web development all in one language.
# - **Flask**: A Python library used to create web applications (websites). It helps us make a web page where users can talk to the chatbot.
# - **Keras/TensorFlow**: Libraries used for creating and working with machine learning models. The chatbot uses this to understand what users say and respond accurately.
# - **NumPy**: A library used for handling large amounts of data (arrays) and performing mathematical operations. It's essential for the chatbot to process the data efficiently.
# - **NLTK**: A library used to understand and manipulate natural language. We need it to break sentences into words and prepare those words for the chatbot.
# - **Pickle**: Used for saving and loading data such as models, words, and responses in a simple file format.
